ğŸ‘‹ Hi folks! Iâ€™m Elias Haddad and I'm a first year computer science student at the University of Rochester. 

- Iâ€™m interested in a number of CS related concepts, especially iOS app dev, data mining/analysis, AI/ML, and more.
- I'm currently working on a cool IOS mobile app centered on discovering architectural landmarks.
- Feel free to reach out with any thoughts or ideas:
