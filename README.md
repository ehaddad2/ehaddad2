ğŸ‘‹ Hi folks! Iâ€™m Elias Haddad and I'm a first year computer science student at the University of Rochester. 

- Iâ€™m interested in a number of CS related concepts, especially android app dev, data mining/analysis, and AI/ML.
- I'm currently working on a cool android mobile app centered on discovering architectural landmarks, check out the preview in my repos! (it's private so let me know if you're interested)
- Feel free to reach out with any thoughts or ideas:
